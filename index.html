<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We propose a new animation technique, called flock morphing, to create special morphing effects between two arbitrary 3D objects by combining the features of 3D morphing and flock animation. Its core idea is first to tetrahedralize the source 3D mesh and regard each tetrahedron as an agent in a flock, and then continually generate the flock morphing animation until the target mesh emerges, formed by the same set of tetrahedra. By applying plausible trajectory planning scheme and smooth deformation algorithm, we demonstrate that our proposed method can simultaneously achieve visually desired morphing effects.</p>

</h3>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Collective behavior of winged insects is a wondrous and familiar phenomenon in the real world. In this paper, we introduce a highly efficient field-based approach to simulate various insect swarms. Its core idea is to construct a smooth yet noise-aware governing velocity field that can be further decomposed into two sub-fields: (i) a divergence-free curl noise field to model noise-induced movements of individual insects in a swarm, and (ii) an enhanced global velocity field to control navigational paths in a complex environment along which all the insects in a swarm fly. Through simulation experiments and comparisons with existing crowd simulation approaches, we demonstrate that our approach is effective to simulate various insect swarm behaviors including aggregation, positive phototaxis, sedation, mass-migrating, and so on. Besides its high efficiency, our approach is very friendly to parallel implementation on GPUs (e.g., the speed-up achieved through GPU acceleration is higher than 50 if the number of simulated insects is more than ten thousands on an off-the-shelf computer). Our approach is the first multi-agent modeling system that introduces curl-noise into agents' velocity field and uses its non-scattering nature to maintain non-colliding movements in 3D crowd simulation.</p>
